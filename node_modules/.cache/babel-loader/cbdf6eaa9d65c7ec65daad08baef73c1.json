The poor score may be attributed \n                        to common barriers such as time constraints, high prices of healthy food, and greater accessibility to junk food (Sogari et al., 2018).\n                        When individuals gain independence for the first time and begin making their own food decisions in college, \n                        eating habits and preferences can be determined during this time (Deshpande et al., 2009). \n                        Therefore, it is critical to establish healthy practices when it comes to eating during these formative years.\n                    </p>\n                    <hr />\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>\n                            Manal Sunbul, Pradtana Tapanee, Nicole Reeder, Samantha Sockwell, Allie Cowles, Evaluating Diet Quality of College Students Using the Healthy Eating Index, \n                            Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, Volume 51, Issue 7, Supplement, 2019, Page S37, ISSN 1499-4046, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.386.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            Sameer Deshpande, Michael D.

This hardship may be attributed to a variety of problems like a lack of \n                    engagement or dyscalculia. However, first grade educators often times allow the student to continue onto the next grade, despite the student’s inability to meet the standard. \n                    As the student progresses onwards, he or she will continue to face difficulties to grasp the increasingly challenging math concepts. From 3rd to 10th grade, \n                    20% of students fail to meet the Common Core Standard set by Washington state. With math being a general requirement for education,\n                    it is critical for students to have a strong foundation of math concepts at an early age, so that they can succeed in their future schoolwork. \n                </p>\n                <h4>Information Problem</h4>\n                <p>\n                    One aspect of the problem is student engagement. As students respond well to gamification or game-based learning, \n                    a solution could be a math app that positions problems in the form of a game.  Another aspect of the problem is broadening the student’s toolset in solving math problems. \n                    A technology solution would allow the student to have a greater amount of randomized problems that require the user to solve them in different ways. \n                    Lastly, students may have trouble acquiring resources outside of school that will help fortify their math education. \n                    An online solution would allow them to have access to problems anywhere.\n                </p>\n                <div id='habihero-paper'> \n                    <iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JYGAFIVOcd920waF8Ibto050LlBl9hd/preview\" />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className='design-container'>\n                <h3>Design</h3>\n                <div className='wireframe-container'>\n                    <img className='wireframe' src='../img/projects/habihero/paper-wireframe.png' alt='paper wireframe for Habi Hero' />\n                    <div className='wireframe-description'>\n                        <h4>Paper Wireframe</h4>\n                        <p> \n                            In our initial wireframe, users are first taken to a level selection screen where they can choose the Common Core math standard they wish to practice and the endangered animal they will help save. \n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            Upon selecting the level, the user is taken to the endangered animal’s environment where they will see various real-world threats to endangered animals. \n                            When the user clicks on a threat within the environment a modal will appear with a math problem that they must solve in order to eliminate the threat from the game’s environment. \n                            After correctly answering the problem the environmental threat will then disappear from the level’s environment and the user may select and solve other threats until they all are completed. \n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className='low-fidelity-container'>\n                    <img className='low-fidelity' src='../img/projects/habihero/low-fidelity.png' alt='low-fidelity prototype for Habi Hero' />\n                    <div className='low-fidelity-description'>\n                        <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype</h4>\n                        <p>\n                            The main additions that we made to our design in this stage was the addition of a leveling progression and a coin reward system. \n                            A leveling system was added to the design to help promote the values of motivation and engagement for first grade users; incentivizing them to continue playing the game in order to level up. \n                            Finally, we decided to incorporate a coin reward system in our design to further engage students and maintain their motivation in practicing math. This coin system acts to positively reinforce students \n                            to complete math problems so that they may gain in game rewards. Lastly, we decided to opt for a writing-to-text input to reinforce the practice of transcribing numbers. \n                            As for the graphic design, we used temporary stock images for our characters. \n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <h4>Visual Elements</h4>\n                <p>\n                    It was important for us to determine branding that was both appealing to 1st graders and relevant to our secondary mission of environmental impact.\n                    We decided to use a color palette that was soft, but simultaenously bright. Shades of green and blue helped tie in our theme of conservation.\n                    As for the game characters, it was important for us to keep as much of the endangered animal’s physical features as realistic as possible.\n                    We did not want our animal characters to be caricatures and disassociate the Habi Hero environment from the actual world. \n                    For our Habi Heroes, we opted for a simple hero design. Both gender and race could be adjusted when creating an account. \n                </p>\n                <h4>Solution</h4>\n            </div>\n            <div className='links-container'>\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default HabiHero;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
